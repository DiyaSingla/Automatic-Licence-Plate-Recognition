# Automatic-Licence-Plate-Recognition
This project uses 3 methods for license plate recognition. 
The first method only uses python libraries : OpenCV. 
The second method deploys the pre trained object detection model: YOLO v3.
The last method deploys the pre trained object detection model: YOLO v5.
In all the methods, optical character reading has been performed using the Python library easyOCR which converrts text in an image into actual text, character by character.
Pred(1). csv stores the license plate numbers obtained from OpenCv method.
Prediction.csv stores the license plate numbers obtained from YOLO v3 model.
